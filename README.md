## Top-Ten Deduplication Datasets:

- Download [Java-large](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2seq#java) dataset.
- Extract methods from class file (i.e. [JavaMethodExtractor](https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/tnpa-generalizability/tree/master/NPM-IST21/JavaMethodExtractor)).
- Apply [DuplicateCodeDetector](https://github.com/microsoft/near-duplicate-code-detector/tree/master/DuplicateCodeDetector) to remove near duplicate methods.
- Select ten most-frequent methods (i.e. [topN](https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/handcrafted-embeddings/blob/master/temp/sample/topN.py)).

## Feature List and Vector Type:

- Run [HandcraftedExtractor](https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/handcrafted-embeddings/blob/master/HandcraftedExtractor) to extract handcrafted embeddings.
- Check [code2vec](https://github.com/tech-srl/code2vec#exporting-the-code-vectors-for-the-given-code-examples) for path-based code vectors.
- Check [naive_embeddings](https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/code_naive_embeddings) for sequence-based naive baselines.
- Check [complexity_embeddings](https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/code_complexity_embeddings) for code complexity metrics.

## SVM-Handcrafted:

- Download source code/binaries of [SVMlight](http://svmlight.joachims.org/).
- Run [data_light.py](https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/handcrafted-embeddings/blob/master/svm-handcrafted/data_light.py) to dump SVMlight format file.
- Run [model_light.py](https://github.com/mdrafiqulrabin/handcrafted-embeddings/blob/master/svm-handcrafted/model_light.py) to train and evaluate SVMlight models.

## Observations:

- Observation 1: The presence of a feature can be used to recognize a method instead of counting the number of occurrences of that feature in programs. On average, the choice of binary vectors has increased the ùêπ1-Score up to 1% than the numeric vectors.
- Observation 2: The code complexity features can be useful to better recognize a method along with the method-only features. On average, the additional code complexity features have increased the ùêπ1-Score up to 2.2% than the method-only features.
- Observation 3: The handcrafted features significantly outperform the sequence of characters (by 59.65%) and the sequence of tokens (by 26.85%) for predicting method name.
- Observation 4: The handcrafted features with a very smaller feature set can achieve highly comparable results to the higher dimensional embeddings of deep neural model such as code2vec.
- Observation 5: Compare to the handcrafted features, the information gains are more evenly distributed in the code2vec embeddings. Moreover, the code2vec embeddings are more resilient to the removal of dimensions with low information gains than the handcrafted features.
